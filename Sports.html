		I play two sports during my high school years, Soccer and Track. Soccer was really fun but our team suck! 
		It gets to the point where I only go to practice just to chills with my friends. Track on the other hand was a workout. 
		It was really difficult at first because I didn't expect the coach to make us go through all those stuff. 
		Track was also fun as well but it was tough. These are all the events I participate:
	<ul>
		<li><i>100m dash</i></li>
		<li><i>200m dash</i></li>
		<li><i>Long Jump</i></li>
		<li><i>High Jump</i></li><br>
	</ul>
		I also did a one mile run as well but after that one time I told coach to get me the hell out of there. 
		I came in dead last and my leg feel like a jelly. In my senior year I decided to not do track, 
		but one of my buddies told me "if you do track in your senior year, you will get a poster". 
		After I heard that I decided that I gotta have that poster no matter what it take. 
		Right now that poster is on the wall back at my parent house.
