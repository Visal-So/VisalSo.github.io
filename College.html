		I was always wanted to go to Mizzou, but I didn't do very well on the ACT test, so I decided to take the other approche. 
		Since I have my A+ I can go to a community college for two years to get my Associate then I can transfer to Mizzou. 
		By doing that I can go to college for two years without costing any money at all.

		On my first day of college I was scared. I was scared that I'm not going to be able to find my classes and ending up look like an idiot. 
		The reason why I felt this way is because of that one video I saw online called "College Senior vs College Freshman". 
		But it wasn't that hard, I ended up finding my classes super fast and it wasn't as complicated as I thought. 
		MIZZOU on the other hand is a completly different story. I have to spend an entire day walking around campus to find all my classes. 
		Beside from that College wasn't anything too different than High School. It's just that College is a different playing field. 
		If you don't pay attention to class, the consequences is bigger than in High School.
		
		I Major in Information Technology, Programming. At first I don't know how I feel about going into the IT field 
		but my parent are one who push me into it. I took a programming class in High School so I know what Programming is. 
		The first language I expirience with was C#. My first ever project is Hello World and my first exam was converting feet to yards.
